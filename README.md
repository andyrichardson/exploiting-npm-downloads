# About

This is an example of how the NPM downloads count can be easily manipulated.

## How it works

### Downloading with lambda

The [lambda](https://github.com/andyrichardson/npm-downloads/blob/main/handler.js) triggers a download from the NPM registry given two arguments:

 - `package` the package to be downloaded
 - `probability` the probability of this run being executed (adds randomness)

### Triggering the lambda

A [cloudwatch rule](https://github.com/andyrichardson/npm-downloads/blob/main/terraform/cloudwatch.tf) runs the aforementioned lambda every second with a set of [arguments](https://github.com/andyrichardson/npm-downloads/blob/main/terraform/cloudwatch.tf#L13).

## Results
